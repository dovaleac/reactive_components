 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

  /**
   * Recursive method for consuming the read buffer. As elements in the read buffer are arranged in
   * blocks, each poll gets a block. If the read buffer is empty, the query to the ReadBuffer will
   * return an empty Maybe, and so, the trigger `IT_WOULD_BE_BETTER_TO_WRITE` would be fired.
   *
   * <p>The results obtained, which come as a map, are then checked against the inner map, so that
   * if they match any of the elements in the map, their inner join gets emitted and the element in
   * this map gets removed from it. Those that don't match with any other element are packed as a
   * Map and sent to the other remnant for being written in its inner map.
   *
   * <p>About synchronizing this method with other processes: when a poll is over, first we check in
   * which state we are. There's a state dedicated to the moment in which there's a poll going on
   * and a sync request is received. That would let the poll go on, but it would change the state to
   * `WAITING_FOR_SYNCHRONIZEE`. When the poll finishes (that is, the elements get shipped to the
   * other remnant), if the state is the aforementioned one, then two things will happen: we don't
   * want to keep polling but instead we want to move to the `SYNCHRONIZEE` state, but first of all
   * we need to deal with elements that are going to get rejected in the other remnant's write
   * buffer.
   *
   * <p>When a remnant requires a sync, given this algorithm, if the other remnant is reading (that
   * is, generating new elements to go to the first remnant's write buffer), only one block of
   * elements will be requested to be added in the write buffer. They will be rejected because the
   * first remnant is already in the `WAITING_FOR_SYNCHRONIZER` state, so we have to think of what
   * to do with them. The thing is that these elements haven't found their match against the other's
   * remnant current inner map, but after the sync, new elements will be added to the inner map;
   * elements against whom the block hasn't tried to match. So, *before* the sync we need to add
   * these elements to the write buffer, so they're taken into account for the sync. There's no need
   * to match them before, because they will be matched as part of the sync. As the write buffer
   * would reject them because it's frozen, we need to add them forcibly
   *
   * <p>When this is done, we can transit to the `SYNCHRONIZEE` state.
   *
   * <p>In case nothing of this happens, we want to call pollRead() again, but increasing the acc.
   * What is that number for? For keeping account that every x tries, we want to check the
   * capacities of our buffers and, in case it's deemed necessary, try to change to a sync.
   *
   * @param acc the accumulator
